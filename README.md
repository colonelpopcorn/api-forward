[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/colonelpopcorn/api-forward.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/colonelpopcorn/api-forward)

This project is currently blocked because Heroku no longer allows http requests on its dynos. I could have just been high though, and that was always the case. Whatever, it's in TS now.

## Mission

Mission is to allow front end projects on fiddles to access restricted resources without having to expose any secrets. Kind of useless if you can't use free-tier Heroku for it, though.
